javascript
let votes = {
    "Party A": 0,
    "Party B": 0,
    "Party C": 0,
    "Party D": 0
};
let votes = { ... }: This line declares a variable named votes using let, which allows for block-scoped variable declaration.
Object Structure: The votes object is initialized with keys representing four political parties ("Party A", "Party B", "Party C", and "Party D") and their corresponding values set to 0. This structure will be used to track the number of votes each party receives.

2. Function to Handle Voting
javascript
function handleVote(selectedParty) {
    votes[selectedParty]++;
    
    document.getElementById('selection').innerText = `You have selected: ${selectedParty}`;
    document.getElementById('selection').classList.remove('hidden'); 

    showResults();
}
Function Declaration: The function handleVote(selectedParty) is defined to process a vote for the selected party.
Incrementing Votes:
votes[selectedParty]++: This line increments the vote count for the party passed as an argument (selectedParty). It uses bracket notation to access the property of the votes object dynamically.
Displaying Selected Party:
document.getElementById('selection').innerText = ...: This line updates the inner text of the HTML element with the ID selection to inform the user which party they have selected.
Showing Selection Message:
document.getElementById('selection').classList.remove('hidden');: This removes the class hidden from the selection element, making it visible on the webpage. The hidden class likely has CSS styles that keep it hidden.
Calling Show Results Function:
showResults();: This line calls the showResults() function to update and display the current voting results immediately after a vote is cast.


3. Function to Show Results
javascript
function showResults() {
    const resultsList = document.getElementById('results-list');
    resultsList.innerHTML = ''; 

    for (const party in votes) {
        const li = document.createElement('li');
        li.innerText = `${party}: ${votes[party]} votes`; 
        resultsList.appendChild(li); 
    }

    document.getElementById('results').classList.remove('hidden');
}
Function Declaration: The function showResults() is defined to display the current voting results on the webpage.
Accessing Results List Element:
const resultsList = document.getElementById('results-list');: This retrieves the HTML element with the ID results-list, where the voting results will be displayed.
Clearing Previous Results:
resultsList.innerHTML = '';: This clears any existing content in the results list, ensuring that only updated results are shown.
Looping Through Votes Object:
for (const party in votes): This loop iterates over each key (party name) in the votes object.
Creating List Item for Each Party:
const li = document.createElement('li');: A new list item (<li>) is created for each party.
Setting Text for List Item:
li.innerText = ${party}: ${votes[party]} votes;: The text of each list item is set to display the party name along with its current vote count (e.g., "Party A: 5 votes").
Appending List Item to Results List:
resultsList.appendChild(li);: Each newly created list item is appended to the results list (<ul>), allowing it to be displayed on the webpage.
Showing Results Section:
document.getElementById('results').classList.remove('hidden');: This removes the hidden class from the results section, making it visible to users after they vote.


4. Adding Event Listeners to Party Buttons
javascript
document.querySelectorAll('.party').forEach(button => {
    button.addEventListener('click', () => {
        const selectedParty = button.getAttribute('data-party'); 
        handleVote(selectedParty); 
    });
});
Selecting Party Buttons:
document.querySelectorAll('.party'): This selects all elements with the class party, which are the buttons representing each political party.
Iterating Over Each Button:
The .forEach(button => { ... }) method iterates over each button element in the NodeList returned by querySelectorAll.
Adding Click Event Listener:
**button.addEventListener('click', () => { ... }): This adds a click event listener to each button. When a button is clicked, it executes the arrow function inside.
Getting Selected Party Name:
const selectedParty = button.getAttribute('data-party');: This retrieves the value of the custom attribute data-party, which contains the name of the party associated with that button.
Handling Vote Submission:
handleVote(selectedParty);: This calls the previously defined handleVote() function, passing in the name of the selected party to process and record the vote.
